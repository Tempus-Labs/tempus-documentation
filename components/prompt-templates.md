# Prompt Templates

## Overview

The Prompt Templates component manages the system prompts and instructions used by the QuantAIAgent. These templates define how the AI agent interacts with users, analyzes market data, and formats responses. The component ensures consistent and effective communication patterns across the framework.

## Basic Concepts

### Template Types

1. **System Prompts**
   * Define agent's role and capabilities
   * Set behavior guidelines
   * Establish response formats
2. **Analysis Templates**
   * Market analysis structures
   * Token evaluation patterns
   * Trend analysis frameworks

## Architecture

```
prompt_templates/
├── quant_ai.py         # QuantAI agent prompts
└── __init__.py         # Package initialization
```

## Basic Usage

### Using Templates

```python
from tempus.prompt_templates.quant_ai import (
    QUANT_AI_CHATBOT_PROMPT,
    QUANT_PUMP_FUN_PROMPT,
    QUANT_AI_PROMPT
)

# Create prompt template
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", QUANT_AI_CHATBOT_PROMPT),
    ("user", "{input}")
])
```

### Customizing Templates

```python
# Extend base template
custom_prompt = QUANT_AI_CHATBOT_PROMPT + """
Additional Instructions:
1. Focus on DeFi metrics
2. Include liquidity analysis
3. Evaluate token utility
"""

# Create template with custom instructions
template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", custom_prompt),
    ("user", "{input}")
])
```
